Documentations for the Base64 version
this version (face_rec_Base64_version) was meant to communicate with an application through the server that 
will send a picture that is converted into a base64 form so we decode this 
base64 form into a normal ‘.jpg’ form then we test the picture then we give it 
to the model and send back the result as a text that will be read by TTS (text to 
speech) feature.

there is two cases for 
Case 1 and Case 2
